# Philanthropy Data Commons: Data Management Practices

Documentation of technical policies about data management in the PDC.

## Data Transformation and Deletion

When a given data set is to be transformed in some way -- including
deletion of that data -- our practice is:

* First file a ticket describing the task.  The ticket can be filed
([here](https://github.com/PhilanthropyDataCommons/meta/issues), or
perhaps in the
[deploy](https://github.com/PhilanthropyDataCommons/deploy/issues) or
the
[data-scripts](https://github.com/PhilanthropyDataCommons/data-scripts/issues)
repository, whichever is most appropriate to the task.

* Assign it to a specific person

* When that person fulfills the task, they should follow up in the
ticket describing precisely what they did (e.g., by giving a command
transcript).  It could be that multiple people are involved in
actually performing the task, but there should still be one assignee
for the ticket: that's the owner -- the person in charge of making
sure that the overall task gets completed.

If there is anything confidential or sensitive about a task, then the
ticket can be filed in an internal tracker at the developer's
organization, but otherwise the rest of this policy still applies.
