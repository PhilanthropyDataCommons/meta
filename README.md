# Philanthropy Data Commons: Data and Software Development Practices

A repository for PDC-wide discussion, documentation, and assets.

As a baseline, [PDC software
projects](https://github.com/PhilanthropyDataCommons/) follow the
coding and developer community guidelines [listed
here](https://code.librehq.com/ots/meta), but individual PDC project
repositories may have additional guidelines that supersede those.
Please consult the documentation for the particular project you're
working in.

For information about what service instances this project uses (e.g.,
production, staging, etc), please see [INSTANCES.md](INSTANCES.md).

For policies about data management, please see
[POLICIES.md](POLICIES.md).
