# Philanthropy Data Commons: Data and Software Development Practices

A repository for PDC-wide discussion, documentation, and assets.

As a baseline, [PDC software
projects](https://github.com/PhilanthropyDataCommons/) follow the
coding and developer community guidelines [listed
here](https://code.librehq.com/ots/meta), but individual PDC project
repositories may have additional guidelines that supersede those.
Please consult the documentation for the particular project you're
working in.

For policies about data management, please see
[POLICIES.md](POLICIES.md).
